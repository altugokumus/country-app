        A country is a geographical and political region that is generally recognized as an independent nation-state, characterized by its own government, economy, culture, and borders that separate it from other countries. Countries can vary in size, population, and level of development, and they often have their own distinct languages, traditions, and social systems. The term "country" can also refer to the land or territory of a nation, as well as its people and their shared history and identity.
